/**
 * The base class for all query operations.
 * Query operations retrieve data from indexing structures according to their specification,
 * but they do not modify the indexed data.
 * Once a query operation is executed on an index structure, its answer is updated.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are three categories of query operations that return different types of answers:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link SingletonQueryOperation} - returns a single {@link AbstractObject}</li>
 * <li>{@link ListingQueryOperation} - returns a collection of {@link AbstractObject}</li>
 * <li>{@link RankingQueryOperation} - returns a distance-ranked collection of {@link AbstractObject}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>

 *
